## What it does
**Vortex** itâ€™s the **first** platform that allows you to create custom contests, promotions and giveaways in the form of a functional NFT; minted on the XRP Ledger and of course using Web3.Storage (IPFS).

A company can create a campaign within **Vortex** and fill it with useful information, such as a campaign name, description, prizes, a collectible image and much more.

Once is created, the owner has the ability to generate a link that redirects to a campaign profile, from which the participants of the contest can add their XRP address and register.

So our platform allows you not just to mint cool images, but to interact with audiences and thousands of people in a way that only the Crypto space can offer.

With **Vortex**, everything from hoodies to VIP passes can be raffled off and **bring the world of bits together with the world of atoms ðŸš€**.
## How we built it
We built **Vortex** using the amazing Javascript SDKs from XRP and Xuum. We use React.JS as our frontend library and Javascript as our backend lenguage with Node.JS. For some data that we need to storage we use MongoDB and of course for the graphic design stuff we used Adobe XD and Adobe Illustrator. We used **Web3.Storage** (IPFS) in order to store the NFTs in a decentralized way.
